## 👋 Hi, I'm Luna

I'm a Computer Science student at **Erasmushogeschool Brussel** with a passion for building small, creative projects in my spare time. These projects often reflect my personal interests and give me a chance to explore technologies I’m curious about, want to master, or see as a challenge.

Some of the pinned repositories on my profile are forks of school-related projects I contributed to using my academic GitHub account — feel free to take a look!

### 🌱 Currently Learning

Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my skills in **Java**, a language I really enjoyed working with in class. I'm excited to dive deeper into its ecosystem and improve through hands-on practice.

You’ll also see a project written in **Kotlin** — it was a quick, week-long challenge! Because of the short timeline, I'm currently revisiting and refactoring the code to improve its quality and structure.
